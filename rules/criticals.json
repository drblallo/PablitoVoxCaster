"In a single bloody hack the target’s leg is lopped off, spurting its vital fluids across the ground. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.",
"With a meaty chop, the leg comes away at the hip. The target pitches to the ground howling in agony before dying.",
"As above, except that the tide of blood is so intense that, for the remainder of the battle, anyone making a Run or Charge Action within six metres of the target must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or be knocked Prone."

	"The attack tears a painful rent in the target’s face. They suffer 1 level of Fatigue. If the target is wearing a helmet, there is no effect. Lucky!",
	"The attack slices open the target’s scalp, which immediately begins to bleed profusely. Due to blood pouring into the target’s eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty to both Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill for the next 1d10 Turns. The target must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer from Blood Loss.",
	"The attack rips open the target’s face, leaving him Stunned for 1d5 Rounds. If the target is wearing a helmet, the helmet is torn off. The target suffers Blood Loss.",
	"The attack slices across one of the target’s eye sockets, possibly scooping out the eye. He must make a Routine (+20) Toughness Test or lose the eye (augmetics can repair this). He also suffers 1d10 Perception Damage.",
	"The attack tears the target’s helmet from his head. If wearing no helmet, the target loses an ear instead, becoming Deafened until he receives medical attention. If he loses an ear, he must also must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer 1 point of permanent Fellowship Damage. The target is Stunned for 1d5 Rounds.",
	"As the blow rips violently across the target’s face it takes with it an important feature. Roll 1d10 to see what the target has lost. 1–3: Eye (see Conditions and Special Damage on page 266), 4–7: Nose (the target  suffers 1d10 permanent Fellowship Damage), 8–10: Ear (the target Deafened until he receives medical attention). In addition, the target is now suffering Blood Loss and suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue.",
	"In a splatter of skin and teeth, the attack removes most of the target’s face. He is permanently blinded and has his Fellowship permanently reduced to 1d10, and also now has trouble speaking without slurring his words. In addition, the target is suffering from Blood Loss and is Stunned for 1 Round.",
	"The blow slices into the side of the target’s head causing his eyes to pop out and his brain to ooze down his cheek like spilled jelly. He’s dead before he hits the ground.",
	"With a sound not unlike a wet sponge being torn in half, the target’s head flies free of its body and sails through the air, landing harmlessly 2d10 metres away with a soggy thud. The target is instantly slain.",
	"As above, except the target’s neck spews blood in a torrent, drenching all those nearby and forcing them to make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test. Anyone who fails the Test suffers a –10 penalty to his Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests for 1 Round as gore fills his eyes or fouls his visor."
