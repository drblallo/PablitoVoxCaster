The character can automatically remember trivial facts or pieces of information the character might feasibly have picked up in the past. When dealing with more detailed, complex, or obscure facts, such as the exact layout of a defence network, the GM may require a successful Intelligence Test to recall the information."

	"aptitude2": "Finesse",
	"effect": "Intensive training allows the character to use a weapon in each hand when needed. When armed with two one-handed weapons (ether melee or ranged weapons), after making a Half Action Attack (this can be a Single Attack, a Swift Attack, or a Lightning Attack with a melee weapon, or a single shot, semi-auto burst, or full auto burst with a ranged weapon), he may make a single additional Half Action Attack following the same restrictions with the other weapon. (In effect, this allows the character to attack twice in a Round; once from each of their weapons). Both of these Attacks count as being part of the same Half Action, and both Tests made to attack with the weapons suffer a –20 penalty.  This Talent may be taken twice, each time with a different focus (melee or ranged). If a character possesses both Talents, then he may fight with one melee and one ranged weapon.  When this Talent is taken with the melee focus it counts as having the Weapon Skill and Finesse Aptitudes, and when it is taken with the ranged focus it counts as having the Ballistic Skill and Finesse Aptitudes.  This Talent may be enhanced by the Blade Dancer, Gunslinger, and Sidearm Talents."

In addition, the character gains a +20 when using the Deceive Skill to either convince someone they have never seen or met him before or if he is trying to appear harmless and ordinary.

Such rapid dislocation from the Warp, through, is stressful and traumatic to the character’s mind and they will suffer 1d5 Energy Damage to the Head location (not reduced by Armour or Toughness) as a result, and may not make any Focus Power Tests or sustain other Psychic Powers until the beginning of his next Turn."

In addition, the character can passively detect psychic effects and entities without the need to actively seek them out.  Whenever the character could detect such a Warp signature or a creature, the GM may allow him to make a Psyniscience Skill Test to detect it, in the same way he might use Awareness to spot an ambush without knowing it is there."

Each additional attack beyond the first counts as a Free Action, but cannot be combined with any other Talents or abilities which would grant extra attacks or hits (i.e. Lightning Attack, Furious Charge, etc.).
